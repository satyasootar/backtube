# Project Setup Steps

## Step 1: Create Project Structure
   - Set up the initial folder and file structure.

## Step 2: Install Dev Tools
   - Installed `nodemon` and `prettier` for development convenience.

## Step 3: Configure Prettier
   - Added `.prettierrc` and `.prettierignore` files to define Prettier settings and ignore patterns.

## Step 4: Connect to MongoDB
   - Created files: `db.js`, `app.js`, `constants.js`, and `index.js`.
   - Installed `mongoose` and `express` packages.
   - Defined `DB_NAME` in `constants.js`.
   - Added `PORT` and `MONGODB_URI` to the `.env` file.
   - Wrote the MongoDB connection code in `db.js` using async/await and a try-catch block.
   - Installed the `dotenv` package to access environment variables globally.
   - Updated `package.json` script to support `dotenv` import.
   - Called the database connection function in `index.js`.

## Step 5: Setup Utility Files
   - Created utility files: `asyncHandler.js`, `APIresponse.js`, and `APIerrors.js`.

## Step 6: Update `app.js`
   - Added additional configurations or middleware as needed in `app.js`.

## Step 7: Define Schemas
   - Wrote schemas for `Video` and `User` models.

## Step 8: Install Additional Packages
   - Installed `jsonwebtoken`, `mongoose-aggregate-paginate`, and `bcrypt` for token handling, pagination, and password hashing.

## Step 9: Implement Middleware for Password Hashing
   - Used `pre` middleware in `user.model.js` to hash passwords before saving them.

## Step 10: Create Access and Refresh Tokens
   - Added user-defined methods in the User model for generating access and refresh tokens.
   - Added token-related keys in the `.env` file for secure access.

## Step 11: Install Cloudinary and Multer Packages
   - Installed `cloudinary` for media storage and `multer` for handling file uploads.

## Step 12: Configure Cloudinary Upload
   - Set up Cloudinary integration to handle media uploads from the server.
   - Added Cloudinary credentials (e.g., `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`, `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`, and `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`) in the `.env` file for secure access.

## Step 13: Configure Multer for Temporary Local Storage
   - Set up Multer to temporarily save uploaded files on the local server.
   - Created a `multer` configuration to specify the storage location and file naming conventions for temporary files before uploading to Cloudinary.
   - Configured Multer to store files in a designated directory (e.g., `./public/temp`) with unique filenames to prevent overwriting.

**The end of backend setup**


# Initiation of Routes and Controllers

## Step 14: Define a Controller "RegisterUser"
   - Define a controller function named `registerUser` that responds with a JSON message: "OK".

## Step 15: Define Routes Using `Router` from `express`
   - Set up routes using the `Router` feature from Express to handle requests related to user registration.

## Step 16: Build Out `registerUser` Controller

1. **Import Required Modules**: Import necessary utilities and modules in the `user.controller.js` file, including functions for handling asynchronous requests, error handling, user model interaction, Cloudinary uploads, and standardized API responses.

2. **Extract User Details**: Extract user details such as `fullName`, `userName`, `email`, and `password` from `req.body`.

3. **Validate Required Fields**: Ensure all required fields are filled in by checking if any of them are empty. If any field is missing, throw an error.

4. **Check for Existing User**: Check the database to see if a user already exists with the provided `userName` or `email`. If a user already exists, throw an error to prevent duplicate entries.

5. **Validate Image Upload**: Confirm that the `avatar` image is provided in `req.files`. If the avatar is missing, throw an error as it is a required field for registration.

6. **Upload Images to Cloudinary**: Upload the `avatar` and `coverImage` (if available) to Cloudinary. This step saves the images in the cloud storage and returns URLs for use in the user profile.

7. **Create User in Database**: Use the user details, along with the Cloudinary URLs for the images, to create a new user entry in the database.

8. **Retrieve Created User**: Fetch the newly created user from the database while excluding sensitive fields, such as `password` and `refreshToken`, from the response.

9. **Validate User Creation**: Ensure that the user creation process was successful by checking if the created user is present. If not, throw an error indicating an issue with the registration process.

10. **Return Success Response**: If all steps succeed, return a JSON response indicating successful registration, along with the newly created userâ€™s data, using the standardized `APIresponse` format.
